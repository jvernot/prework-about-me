      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a young professional working in the digital world looking to become a master coder!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am originally from just outside of Philadelphia, and hold tightly to those roots.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Sport are a HUGE hobby of mine. I love watching, playing, talking, and debating (which admittedly turns to arguing at times) about them. Outside of that, I love to travel and explore new places and food! </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I can't say that I have ever had one specific dream job. If I had to choose it would most likely be a hybrid of the digital world and sports. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I am coming up on my 6th year of living in Raleigh.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have always enjoyed solving puzzles as well as creating and building things. Web development will be a completely new challenge for me, but it will allow me to do some of the things that I truly enjoy on a day to day basis in a way that I never thought possible. The opportunity to be creative in the digital space is something that I will really enjoy. </p>
